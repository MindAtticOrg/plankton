Problems

Global Impact of Scams
In 2023, scams stole $1 trillion from the most vulnerable people, largely because many were unable to recognize fraud.
Underfunded and Slow Education 
Global cybersecurity training is valued at just $4.53 billion, yet for every $1 spent on it, $220 is lost to scams.
Growing Threat in Web3
In 2021, $14 billion was lost to crypto scams – 150 million users worldwide.
In 2023, $25–$30 billion was lost to crypto scams, just 2-3% of total scam losses – 400 million users worldwide.
Projected Increase
By 2026, losses could reach $150 billion a year due to scams, rug pulls, and false promises – 1 billion users worldwide.
Effects
Trust Erosion – Frequent scams and high-profile rug pulls erode trust in Web3, hindering funding for legitimate projects and increasing losses and fear across the ecosystem.
Large User Pool Effect – The overwhelming success of scammers attracts more bad actors to the Web3 space.
